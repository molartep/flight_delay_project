# Introduction
The aviation industry is one of the most critical transportation sectors, providing fast and convenient means of travel for people and goods. On-time performance of flights is a critical aspect of the aviation industry that affects the satisfaction of customers and the reputation of the airlines. The aim of this project is to estimate the delays of flights between RDU (Raleigh-Durham International Airport) and MIA (Miami International Airport) using carrier on-time performance data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and weather data from NCDC NOAA datasets.
The rationale behind this project is to provide insights into the factors that contribute to flight delays and to develop a model that can predict the delay of flights. This information can be useful for both airlines to plan their operations and for customers to make informed decisions about their travel plans.
